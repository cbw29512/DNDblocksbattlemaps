## Current Status

**Phase:** Stage 1 — Single-User Builder Prototype — room stamping and core placement usability in active browser verification  
**Application code:** Yes. Stage 1 began after explicit user authorization on 2026-10-07.  
**Repository:** `cbw29512/DNDblocksbattlemaps`  
**Primary goal:** Make fast multi-room construction work cleanly, then move into the real block/character/monster catalog. Netlify remains production and is not used for routine testing.

## Current Product Definition

DND Blocks Battle Maps is a browser-based virtual tabletop modeled after physical magnetic dungeon terrain.

The DM selects simple blocks and places them on a grid.

Examples:

- grass = grass block
- stone = stone block
- door = door block
- torch = torch block
- table = table block
- player = player block
- monster = monster block or one multi-square entity

The DM is the authority. The board must work without automated RPG rules.

## Current Locked Decisions

1. **Simple first.** Ease and speed are the main competitive advantage.
2. **Kid-simple UI.** A child should be able to understand the basic build/play flow without reading a manual.
3. **Cheap first.** Initial hosting, persistence, assets, services, and infrastructure should use reliable free or near-free options whenever practical.
4. **Stage 1 code is active.** Product contracts remain authoritative; implementation must follow them and update the live handoff.
5. **Documentation is part of the work.** A task is not complete until this live state has been updated and pushed.
6. **Resume-first workflow.** Before making changes, read this file and the governing docs.
7. **One square = 5 feet.**
8. Small/Medium = 1x1, Large = 2x2, Huge = 3x3, Gargantuan = 4x4. Multi-square creatures remain one entity.
9. **Everything is data-driven.** Reuse universal object behaviors instead of object-specific engines.
10. **DM controls the world.** Players only control assigned pieces and allowed interactions.
11. **Blocks snap to the grid.**
12. **No ordinary object rotation is required.** Art should identify a block from all useful sides.
13. **Construction can be locked** to prevent accidental movement.
14. **DM-only/hidden objects** are required; the DM can reveal them.
15. **Prefab rooms are recipes for normal blocks**, not a separate runtime system.
16. Future prefab rooms should accept real-world dimensions such as 40x20 feet.
17. The board should have a simple BUILD mode and PLAY mode concept.
18. Rules automation, if ever added, remains optional. The DM must always be able to decide what happens.
19. **No automatic ceilings.** Rooms stay open from above until ceiling/roof behavior is deliberately revisited.
20. **Primary DM build controls:** left-click sidebar item to select, left-click map to place, right-click placed block to remove.
21. **Room builder:** DM enters Length × Width × Height; the room is generated from ordinary blocks and can be bulk locked/unlocked.
22. **Trap movement lock is universal behavior.** A trigger can apply a movement lock to a player piece until the DM clears it.
23. **Web-first/open-source-first stack.** Prefer browser-native, permissively licensed, free/near-free technology and reuse mature components instead of building commodity infrastructure.
24. **No custom server by default.** The MVP should avoid a dedicated backend if browser + hosted open-source services can safely satisfy persistence/auth/realtime requirements.
25. **Room spatial contract.** Length/Width/Height are entered in feet, snap to 5-foot increments, Length × Width mean usable interior space, and Height means wall height.
26. **Door placement.** A door replaces the lowest wall block at its wall position; wall blocks above remain.
27. **Room lock scope.** Lock Room protects construction/environment positions and removal, not player/monster/NPC movement; allowed state changes still work.
28. **Universal occupancy.** Solid vs overlay and generic movement-blocking are board primitives so traps can share a cell with creatures while walls/closed doors can block space.
29. **Camera contract.** Default camera elevation is near 30° above the board plane; vertical tilt is locked for MVP; users may orbit horizontally, pan, zoom, and Reset/Home.
30. **DM-authoritative placement.** BUILD mode allows intentional overlap/stacking; occupancy may warn but does not reject DM placement.
31. **Universal trigger/effect system.** Traps, hazards, switches, ambushes, and surprises are composed from reusable triggers/effects rather than named engines.
32. **Universal transform/replace.** An object may change identity/category/capabilities in place when triggered, such as chest → mimic.
33. **Select once, place many.** A palette item remains active until changed/cleared; repeated clicks place repeated copies.
34. **Face-aware block placement.** Empty grid places at the current elevation; top face builds one level up; side face builds one grid cell outward at the clicked block's base elevation. The placement preview must show the exact resulting destination before click.
35. **Floating placement allowed.** DM may deliberately place unsupported elevated objects; no physics validator blocks creation.
36. **Pick-up/put-down movement.** Unlocked existing objects are moved by selecting/picking up and dropping, not transform gizmos.
37. **Overlap chooser only when needed.** Ambiguous overlapping selections use a minimal What's Here? chooser rather than a permanent object inspector.
38. **Undo/Redo is Stage 1 safety infrastructure.** Fast placement/removal should remain confirmation-free because board edits are reversible.
39. **Low-friction player join.** DM uses a durable signed-in identity; players join via link/code + display name with a lightweight session identity and no required standalone account in MVP.
40. **DM assigns pieces.** Players control only assigned entities; DM may assign/reassign at any time and always retains override.
41. **Player UI stays minimal.** No build tools; players see map, owned piece, visible objects, camera controls, and relevant interactions only.
42. **Tiny creatures keep the 5-foot grid.** Tiny pieces share a 5-foot square and auto-offset visually rather than introducing a permanent 2.5-foot subgrid.
43. **Current state is canonical.** Maps load from current persisted state, not by replaying the entire edit history.
44. **Autosave is continuous.** Every committed board edit enters the save pipeline; ordinary use does not require a manual Save button.
45. **Undo is compensating history.** Undo/Redo uses reversible commands; Undo records an inverse edit instead of deleting history.
46. **Revision + action IDs protect realtime.** Game/map revisions detect gaps/staleness and unique action IDs deduplicate retries/reconnects.
47. **Realtime sends logical edits, not frames.** Movement sync transmits committed grid moves/state changes rather than animation frames.
48. **Accepted MVP stack.** TypeScript + Vite + Three.js + native HTML/CSS first + Supabase + Netlify; no custom app server initially.
49. **Renderer is an adapter.** Authoritative world state drives Three.js; renderer objects are never the canonical state.
50. **Shared walls are one object.** Adjacent generated rooms reuse one compatible wall WorldObject with membership in multiple RoomRegions; it is effectively locked if any associated room is locked.
51. **Visual feedback is kid-readable and original.** Placement/ownership/hidden/lock/Tiny states use shape/icon/text/opacity cues and never rely on color alone; no copied Minecraft/VTT art.
52. **Implementation rules are mandatory.** Coding must be state-first, universal-behavior-first, testable, error-aware, and documentation-complete.
53. **Dependency/license register is mandatory.** No third-party code or asset enters the repo before source/version/license/purpose/provenance are recorded.
54. **Explicit coding gate.** Stage 1 application code does not begin until the pre-implementation checklist is satisfied and the user explicitly directs implementation.
55. **Public website is part of the product.** The homepage must look polished, explain the product immediately, and make Build a Map / Join a Game obvious.
56. **Terrain quick-start is a conversion path.** Castle/Inn/Field/Sea/Volcano-style cards can open a temporary builder immediately; durable sign-in is required when saving/sharing a persistent game.
57. **One Vite product surface.** Marketing site and app remain in the same repo/project unless a real requirement later justifies separation.
58. **Local-first release discipline.** Normal development/testing is local; GitHub pushes are coherent checkpoints; Netlify production deploys are deliberate milestone releases.
59. **GitHub Pages is test-only.** It may host temporary static prototype builds for browser testing, but Netlify remains the production/commercial host.
60. **Pages deploys are manual-only.** Normal GitHub pushes do not automatically publish the test site.
61. **Iron Pit monster silhouettes are the default monster face art.** Reuse the Chris-approved assets at `D20-ironpit/frontend/assets/portraits/monsters/{id}.webp` on monster blocks/standees, keyed by catalog/art ID rather than monster-specific rendering code.
62. **Preserve silhouette identity discipline.** Do not substitute related creature art when Iron Pit already distinguishes variants, sizes, ages, or renamed edition creatures.
63. **Vertical build cap is 8 blocks / 40 ft.** Taller stacks leave the useful tabletop view; room height and manual elevation share this cap.
64. **Placement shadow is authoritative feedback.** The landing footprint/shadow must sit on the exact destination surface/cell so stacking and side placement remain obvious.
65. **Zoom remains simple but farther.** Keep fixed camera elevation; allow more zoom-out so the 8th block can remain inspectable.
66. **Room Builder labels are plain-language and readable.** Use full Length/Width/Height labels, vertically stacked fields, high contrast, and a large Build Room action; do not compress core dimensions into tiny L/W/H controls.
67. **Build Room arms a reusable room stamp.** The DM chooses dimensions, clicks Build Room, then clicks a grid square that becomes the room's outside wall corner. The stamp can grow in any of four grid directions, auto-flips to stay on the map, and remains active for rapid multiple-room placement until a normal block is selected.
68. **Room preview is explicit.** Gold outline/corner means the room fits; red means it would leave the board or exceed the vertical cap. One stamped room is one Undo/Redo action.
69. **Exact shared structural positions are reused.** Generated rooms do not create duplicate wall blocks at the same X/Z/elevation.
70. **Room stamps choose direction automatically.** From the clicked outside-wall corner, test all four grid directions, reject out-of-bounds directions, and prefer a valid direction with less existing construction overlap. The preview must show the exact chosen direction before click.

## Cost Guardrail

This project is being built as cheaply as practical at the start.

Before adopting any paid dependency or hosted service, document:

- what requirement it solves
- free/low-cost alternatives considered
- current free tier or expected cost
- the threshold that would create meaningful cost
- whether it can be replaced later without rewriting the project

Do not introduce a paid service merely for convenience if a dependable free or near-free option meets the current need.

## Current Competitive Position

Specific voxel/3D VTT research has now been completed and documented.

Key findings:

- **Terrablox** is the closest direct competitor: a 3D voxel VTT with block building, tokens, fog, dice, and multiplayer.
- **VOXEL Tabletop** is the closest browser-oriented voxel product found.
- TaleSpire, The RPG Engine, and RPG Stories validate demand for 3D building but also demonstrate the prep-time, UI-complexity, installation, and feature-bloat risks this project is intended to avoid.
- The project thesis is therefore **not** "voxel VTTs do not exist."
- The working differentiation is: **browser-first, deliberately simple semantic blocks, fixed tabletop-friendly defaults, minimal setup, DM authority, and encounter creation measured in minutes rather than detailed world-building.**

The closest product to watch is Terrablox. The closest browser product to watch is VOXEL Tabletop.

See `docs/COMPETITOR_RESEARCH.md`.

## Remaining Implementation-Time Decisions

These are intentionally deferred until implementation/testing provides evidence. They are **not product-design blockers** for Stage 1.

1. Exact package versions and transitive license notices immediately before installation.
2. Exact Supabase authentication/session implementation details within the locked durable-DM/lightweight-player contract.
3. Exact original/CC0 placeholder asset production pipeline.
4. Numeric bounded Undo/Redo history retention after real usage/storage testing.
5. Performance thresholds and tuning based on target browser/device testing.

## Latest Work Record

### Date

2026-10-07

### Starting State

The first reusable room-stamp checkpoint was green, but the stamp still grew in only one fixed +X/+Z direction from the clicked corner.

That meant it was movable, but it was not truly an **instant room anywhere it fits** tool.

### Changes Made

- Split room dimension logic from room placement/orientation logic.
- Added a universal RoomPlacement model:
  - clicked outside-wall corner
  - X direction: +1 or -1
  - Z direction: +1 or -1
- Every clicked room corner now evaluates all four directional layouts.
- Directions that leave the board or exceed the 40-ft height cap are rejected.
- Near map edges, the room automatically flips inward.
- When more than one direction fits, the stamp prefers a direction with less existing construction overlap.
- The 3D preview moves its footprint/wireframe to exactly match the chosen direction.
- The fallback renderer uses the same room-placement decision.
- The room actually generated by the builder uses the same RoomPlacement object shown in the preview.
- Room stamp remains armed after placement for rapid repeated rooms.
- Existing identical wall positions remain duplicate-suppressed.
- Added tests for:
  - all four room directions
  - automatic edge flipping
  - choosing an alternate valid direction
  - avoiding heavily occupied room footprints
  - vertical-cap rejection
  - room Undo
- Corrected stale checklist/docs that still claimed room generation, side placement, or Stage 1 code were not implemented.
- Fixed one strict TypeScript issue in the fallback preview orientation after CI correctly caught it.
- Netlify remains untouched.

### Verification

Feature commit:

- `612e02d0e93416de2c38f03165421dc72c966afa`

Strict typing correction:

- `1b0eebd11b09b6941b281fd38864517ec378340c`

Connected verification:

- **Deploy GitHub Pages Test run #8:** SUCCESS
- **GitHub pages build and deployment run #20:** SUCCESS
- TypeScript typecheck: passed
- unit tests: passed
- static build: passed
- Pages deployment: passed

The temporary push trigger is restored to manual-only in this cleanup commit.

### Decision

**Create Room means “instant room anywhere it fits.”**

The DM chooses dimensions and points to a corner. The software tests all four directions, chooses a valid low-overlap direction, and shows that exact result before click.

### Cost Impact

None.

No new dependency, service, or Netlify deploy.

### Result

Smart four-direction room stamping is verified and live on the GitHub Pages test surface.

### Exact Next Step

1. Hard-refresh the test site.
2. Test room stamping near each map edge.
3. Stamp several rooms around existing rooms without returning to the sidebar.
4. Confirm the gold preview direction matches the room that appears.
5. If that interaction is clean, begin the real construction/prop/character/monster catalog.
